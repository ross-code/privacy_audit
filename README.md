# Privacy Audit

## Understand where you're vulnerable online

### Overview

#### Privacy Audit is a compilation of Open Source tools that allow users to input their information to see where they are vulnerable.

### Features

#### Users will be walked through the Privacy Audit in this order:

#### The first feature will use the API for Have I Been Pwned. The email that user signed up with will be used to search through the API to be alerted for any data breaches their email has been involved in.

#### The second feature will use the Intelligence X API to allow the user to search for themselves in open source databases. This allows user to understand where sensitive information is available about themselves such as address, phone number, income, etc. There will be recommendations about how to remove or control this information.

#### The third feature will use CRXcavator to check your Chrome extensions and let you know if they are safe from a privacy and security standpoint. 

#### The fourth feature will be a tool to check the strength of a password. User inputs a password and receiveds a rating for how strong it is and recommendations for how it can be improved.

#### Further iterations of this project will have features to actively improve your privacy and security posture such as a random password generator, a feature to send masked emails and texts, and a library of links to resources that will further their privacy and security.

### Data

#### Privacy Audit will have a model for each user that will store their email, password, and as many secondary emails, phone numbers, or aliases as they'd like to audit.
